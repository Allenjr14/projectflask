# projectflask
assignment : job recommending application 
This application is fully build using flask from python,html and css. so basically the project is to build a application and a user can visit and can search his job . Here to build the rest api I have used flask which was easy . about the project ,firstly user can find a home page where he can see the common home page with navigation button and some paragraph . Then the user should login using login button , the page will redirect to the login page where user can input name and email.
After login the will redirect to the user page where user should choose the option like their type of role they are searching for , Then a page will show them the details of the company, job, location and etc.
Here for the navigation bar I have used bootsrcap to import navigation styles 
To be sure , This is not a fully function website because there is no database, the database was given in json format and iam still learning process
This project will be a simple and basic , and for reference i referred websites like greeksforgreeks.com, tutorialpoint.com, fullstackpython.com and some youtube videos.
